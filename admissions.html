                            <br>
                            <span>Thank you for browsing the JCS website and we hope it gives you a flavour of our school’s ethos. If you are already in Jogjakarta, please visit the school and see it in action. By doing this you will gain a true ‘feel’ for the school and appreciate the qualities that make up JCS. We are confident that you will find our school a safe and happy environment, where staff and students interact meaningfully and positively in each part of the academic, social and physical aspects of our daily lives.
                        <br>  <br>
                                <h3>Making initial enquiries</h3>
                        <br>
                                For general enquiries regarding the school and enrolment, please contact our Office Manager at <a href=officemanager@jogjacommunityschool.org>officemanager@jogjacommunityschool.org</a> or call us at +62 (0) 811 2576 164. 
 
 Parents can also register their child for a 3 day trial at the school to experience first hand what JCS has to offer. This can be arranged by making an appointment with the office, completing a short application form and agreeing on the trial days. The trial is a no-obligation, free of charge opportunity to experience our school.

                        <br>

                            <h3>ADMISSIONS / ENROLMENT PROCEDURES</h3>
                            <br> Here is a step-by-step guide to enrolling your child at JCS.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Pre-Registration</strong>
                            <br> JCS has an academically non-selective enrolment policy. However, we use the following criteria before enrolment to ensure that we meet the needs of all students of each class. Please consider these criteria before beginning the registration process.
                            <br> This range of subjects gives the students a broad understanding and knowledge and enables students to develop independent learning, along with time and organisation management, inquiry and reflective skills.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Year Group Eligibility</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            <img src="images/table_admissions.png" alt=" " class="center" />
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Language</strong>

                            <br>In EYFS and Key Stage 1 classes it is not required that students are fluent in English. Children of this age are able to learn from their peers through play and during lessons, nonetheless, children will be given additional support in English language development as needed. All our lessons, with the exception of Indonesian, are taught in English and as such, children from Year 3 upwards are required to have a reasonable command of the English language to support their learning. The school will make an assessment of spoken and written English skills of new students.
                            <br> <br>
                            <strong>Age</strong>

                            <br>Our school year groups are determined in accordance with the National Curriculum of England and Wales without exception. Please see the table above in order to determine the appropriate age group for your child. We adopt this principle to ensure that your child is educated within a suitably aged peer group.
                            <br> <br>
                            <strong>Key Stage 4 entrants</strong>

                            <br>Children will only be accepted into Year 10 if they are joining from a British curriculum school or they are able to complete the registration assessments to a level that demonstrates they are able to access, understand and cope with the academic rigour of IGCSE examinations delivered entirely in the English language. <br><br>Children will only be accepted in Year 11 if they are currently in a British curriculum school and they are already following the IGCSE programme of study.
                            <br> <br>
                            <strong>Children with identified needs</strong>

                            <br>JCS is a small school and does not have the support of specialist teachers or a Learning Development Unit. It is with regret that currently we cannot offer places to children requiring additional support.
                            <br> <br>
                            <h3>Nationality</h3>

                            <br>We welcome a mix of nationalities into our student body and as part of our anti-discrimination ethos, we do not have priority for any one nationality. Nationality is determined on the basis of the passport held by the student.
                            <br> <br>
                            <h3>Contact Admissions</h3>

                            <br>The next step is to contact us at <a href='officemanager@jogjacommunityschool.org'>officemanager@jogjacommunityschool.org </a> or call us at +62 (0) 811 2576 164 to make an appointment to visit the school, to find out more information about us or to arrange an entrance assessment.
                            <br> <br>
                            <h3>Entrance Assessment</h3>

                            <br>Upon the decision to enrol your child, it will be necessary to arrange an entrance assessment. This can be arranged through our Office Manager using the contact details outlined above. If you are applying from overseas, the office will make any necessary online arrangements with parents and the child’s current school.<br><br> In Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and Key Stage 1, parents and children will be invited to attend a meeting with the teacher. All other students will take a short assessment in English and Mathematics which will be administered by JCS staff. The different styles of assessments are used to determine if we are able to offer a place in school and to ensure a child is ready and at the correct level for learning within JCS.
                            <br> <br>
                            <h3>Registration</h3>

                            <br>
                            <strong>Step 1:</strong> <br> On being offered a place at JCS, parents will be contacted by the Office Manager. At this stage parents will be asked to complete and submit the school registration form, along with the registration payment of $250.00 USD per child (or Rupiah equivalent) in order to secure the place. The registration fee is non-refundable.
                            <br> <br>
                            <strong>Step 2:</strong> <br> Once all the registration documentation has been received and signed by both parties, the Office Manager will issue the start date, the payment invoice and any other relevant information required for your child to join JCS.
                            <br> <br>
                            <h3>TUITION FEE PAYMENT</h3>

                            <br>Tuition fees are outlined separately in the Fee Schedule. Please contact the office manager for the most recent schedule.<br><br> Families with more than 2 children enrolled at JCS qualify for a discount of 10% on the tuition of the 3 rd child and 15% on the tuition of the 4 th child enrolled at JCS.
                            <br> <br> Please note:
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tuition fees can be paid in instalments or paid in full at the beginning of the year. Please see the Fee Schedule for details.</li>
                                <li>Children enrolling after the start of Term 1 will be required to pay pro-rata school fees for the portion of the school year they are in attendance. This will be invoiced when your child joins the school.</li>
                                <li>Baseline test fees (administered at the beginning of each key stage) are an additional cost, separate from school fees (applies to Key Stages 2, 3 and 4). Parents will be notified in advance of the tests taking place.</li>
                                <li>Externally set examinations such asIGCSE and A levels incur examination fees. These are an additional cost, separate from school fees and are to be paid by the student prior to the examinations being taken.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br> Some parents may wish to make an advance payment on tuition fees for the following academic year. Please note, if an advance payment is made before tuition fees have been set for the new academic, the school will request the difference to be paid.
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>WITHDRAWAL OF A STUDENT</h3>
                            <br>A parent withdrawing their child from JCS must provide earliest possible notification in writing to the Principal.

In the case of annual tuition payment, a pro-rata refund will be made if notification of withdrawal is provided before the start of the beginning of the following term. The registration fee is non-refundable.
                            <br><br> (Note: ‘Withdrawal’ is the date upon which the student ceases to attend and where the name is officially removed from the enrolment list. Administrative fees will be applied to refunds.)
                            <br> <br>

                            Please note - reports, new school application requests and recommendation letters cannot be released from the school unless the above criteria have been met.
                            <br> <br>

                            <strong>LATE PAYMENT</strong>

                            <br>All fees are due as outlined in the Fee Schedule. Payments must be made within 2 weeks from the stipulated due dates. If payment is not received within this extended period, an administration fee of $100 USD or Rupiah equivalent will be added to the monies owed. If the fees are not received within 4 weeks of the first due date, the Principal will inform the parent(s) that their child may no longer attend JCS until all fees are paid and remove the student immediately.
                            <br><br> The school administration must, at all times, strictly adhere to this policy. Any exception to this policy, if necessitated by exceptional reasons, must be approved in advance by the Principal.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>DETERMINING TUITION FEES</strong>

                            <br>JCS has no external investment or endowment fund; it is funded entirely from tuition fees. JCS is a non-profit entity; all income is used to provide a quality learning experience and the development of the school facilities. Non-payment or late payment of fees causes significant operational difficulties and compromises the quality of service.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>RESERVATION</strong>

                            <br>JCS must operate within acceptable educational limits and we aim to provide a positive outcome for children and parents.
                            <br> The school reserves the right to reject an application or a re-registration to JCS on the following grounds:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the year group appropriate to the applicant is already full</li>
                                <li>If, in our professional judgement, the applicant or student is not suited to the programme offered by the school</li>
                                <li>Non-payment of fees
                                </li>
